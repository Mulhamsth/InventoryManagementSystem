<p>The Inventory Management System is designed with Razor/Blazor components and incorporates various features such as form validation,
	custom validation with ValidationAttribute, dependency injection, and clean architecture with Use Case Driven Development.
	The system also includes a specific type of data store in-memory plugin using the repository pattern as plugins following clean architecture.
	However, the system is flexible enough to easily accommodate other types of data storage due to its clean architecture.</p>

<h1>Explanation:</h1>
<p>
	The Inventory Management System is a project that I created while learning Blazor, and it incorporates several features such as form validation, custom validation with ValidationAttribute, dependency injection, and clean architecture with Use Case Driven Development.

	While it is not a professional application, it serves as an excellent example of what can be achieved with Blazor and the features it provides. The system's form validation capabilities help ensure data accuracy and completeness, and its custom validation with ValidationAttribute allows for the implementation of unique validation requirements.

	The Inventory Management System follows a clean architecture approach, promoting code clarity and separation of concerns. Additionally, it incorporates dependency injection, which simplifies the management of dependencies and promotes a modular codebase.

	The system's data storage capabilities are reliable and efficient, utilizing an in-memory plugin with the repository pattern as plugins following clean architecture. While the system is not intended as a professional business solution, its features and flexibility can provide valuable insight into inventory management operations.

	Overall, the Inventory Management System serves as an excellent example of what can be achieved with Blazor and its capabilities, and it can be a useful tool for learning and experimentation.
