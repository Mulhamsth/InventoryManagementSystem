# InventoryManagementSystem
The Inventory Management System is designed with Razor/Blazor components and incorporates various features such as form validation, custom validation with ValidationAttribute, dependency injection, and clean architecture with Use Case Driven Development. The system also includes a specific type of data store in-memory plugin using the repository pattern as plugins following clean architecture. However, the system is flexible enough to easily accommodate other types of data storage due to its clean architecture.
